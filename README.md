# nosql-challenge

I have included the NoSQL_setup_starter and the NoSQL_analysis_starter Jupyter Notebooks, with all of the required elements performed. 

First, I imported the json resource, using `mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --jsonArray establishments.json`. Once that was imported and the database and collection was named, I successfully added the new restaurant and performed the edits requested. 

Once done with the setup_starter notebook, I answered the questions in the analysis_starter notebook. I completed the necessary queries, generated results, and converted all query results to Pandas DataFrames.
